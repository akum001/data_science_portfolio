# Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools:

* Python: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib 
* Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Octave

## Contents

   * ## Data Analysis and Visualization (Python Programming)
     
     - [911 Calls - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/akum001/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/911%20Calls%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
     - [Titanic disaster - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/akum001/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Notebook1.ipynb): Data Analysis, feature engineering, detecting outliers in the features and resolving them, analysis of finding good features by finding relationship between columns and visualizing them with different kind of plots.
     - [Stock market Analysis](https://github.com/akum001/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Stock%20Market%20Analysis.ipynb): In this notebook i have done analysis on Stock data of Apple, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, and tried to find out when was their highest return and when they suffered recession and which one is the highly riskiest stock among them.  

   * ## Machine Learning
     - [Titanic disaster - prediction](https://github.com/akum001/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Titanic_classification.ipynb): Data Analysis, feature engineering, detecting outliers in the features and resolving them, analysis of finding good features by finding relationship between columns and visualizing them with different kind of plots. Applying machine learning binary models Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine to fit our data set and predict on test data set that our model hasn't seen yet.
     - [Spam classifier](https://github.com/akum001/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Spam_Classification.ipynb): Spam classification using one of the famous UCI datasets. I have used Naive bayes classifier to train my model using scikit pipeline technique.
